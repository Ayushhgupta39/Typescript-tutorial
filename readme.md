#Typescript tutorial
Typescript is basically writing Javascript, more precisely.

### What Typescript does?
- Static checking.
- Analyze the code, as we type. That's all.
- It's a development tool, the project still runs on Javascript.


## Syntax
```let variableName: type = value ```

### `any` Type
- Don't use any.

When a value is of type ```any```, it means whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
